#### It all started in Zversal Pvt. Ltd., Mohali. It was Parichay Batra, one of my dearest and caring friend, who just introduced myself to a newbie named Anushka Beri. We started working on a project together. I was developing API which she was integrating in UI. There were always few ifs and buts between Frontend and Backend Developer. We worked and worked and created a running application and build our own application called LOVE.
